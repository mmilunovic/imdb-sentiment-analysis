# Sentiment analysis with Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

First project for Machine Learning course. 
<br>1st - Linear regression
<br>2nd - Instance based models (KNN)
<br>3rd - Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews
 
The dataset consists of 1250 positive and 1250 negative movie reviews. Feature extraction was done using **BoW histogram** method. 
I used [tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org) for all three parts with aditional help from [nltk](http://www.nltk.org) for text processing. 
This, very simple, method produced **90-94%** accuracy on training and **80-87%** on the test set.
